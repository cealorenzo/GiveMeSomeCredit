# Credit Default Scoring Project

## Overview

Banks play a crucial role in market economies by deciding who can get finance and on what terms, influencing investment decisions significantly. For markets and society to function efficiently, individuals and companies need access to credit. Credit scoring algorithms estimate the probability of default, helping banks determine whether or not a loan should be granted.

This project aims to improve the state of the art in credit scoring by predicting the probability that a borrower will experience financial distress in the next two years. The goal is to build a model that borrowers can use to help make informed financial decisions.
